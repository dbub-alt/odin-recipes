        <h3 class="desc">Description</h3>
            <p>This. Soup. Fucks. It's the best way to eat vegetbales in the summer. It's refreshing, it's light, and it has a delightful sweet heat. This isn't a traditional recipe. Most recipes will include sourdough bread pieces (Keep the bread on the side, of course). I omitted that to make the soup smoother. Most recipes don't include a jalpapeno. I like the additional heat. It's a unique side dish for a summer dinner that you'll want to make again and again.</p>
